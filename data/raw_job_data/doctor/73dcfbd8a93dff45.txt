 Interested? Please e-mail our administrator, Lucien Roberts, at lroberts@gastrova.com. We’d love to talk with you. Gastrointestinal Specialists, Inc., is always looking for exceptional gastroenterologists to join its team. We are a strong private group with two fully-accredited endoscopy centers, solid relationships with area hospitals and referring physicians, and a ‘group first’ culture. We offer wonderful compensation and benefits, in addition to a 1-in-7 weekend call schedule. 
What separates us from many practices is our group gestalt. We are a cohesive practice, where new associates have an equal voice and vote and where decisions are made as a group. We have each others’ backs.
