The results of the calls you make are immediately sent to the patients healthcare provider.  Our nurses work from home and work whatever hours suit them.  As an independent contractor, you earn $2.50 per successful call (occasionally we offer bonuses and extra rewards.) Most calls are just a few minutes long. Our nurses typically earn around $20-25/hr.  We are looking for registered nurses who are accountable, diligent, and professional when talking to patients over the phone. Our goal is to help improve patient recovery and prevent readmissions by making the invisible patients visible.  You'll need an active license as a Registered Nurse in the United States and valid liability insurance.  Contract work from your own computer. Must ensure HIPAA compliance from home.
